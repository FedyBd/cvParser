## cvParser

Welcome to the cvParser repository! This project is designed to streamline the process of parsing and analyzing CVs through a comprehensive web application. The repository is organized into three branches, each serving a specific part of the application:

## Branches Overview

# Frontend (frontend branch):
Contains the Angular frontend of the website.
This is the user interface where users can upload CVs and view results.

# Backend (backend branch):
Contains the NestJS API.
This API manages user interactions, handles business logic, and communicates with the database.

# Flask Server (flaskserver branch):
Contains a Flask API that processes the CVs.
This server is responsible for parsing the CV content, performing any necessary transformations, and saving the results to the database.


# Setting Up the MySQL Database
Before running the application, you'll need to set up a MySQL database called cvs. This database will be used by both the NestJS and Flask servers.
